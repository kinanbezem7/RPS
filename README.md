MILESTONE 1

Teachable-Machine is a web-based tool that creates machine learning models. This will be used to create a Rock/paper/scizzors game.

The machine has been taught with the labels Rock, Paper, Scizzors, Nothing.
The Tensorflow model is labeled: keras_model.hf
And the class labels: labels.txt

MILESTONE 2

Created new virtual environment using miniconda
Used: open-cv, tensorflow and ipykernal libraries 
Ran the machine learning model on the machine

MILESTONE 4

Created manual_rps.py to create a manual version of the game
Defined get_computer_choice function to generate a random selection of Rock, Paper or Scissors
Defined get_user_choice function to input from user 
Defined get_winner function to decide winner
Defined Play function to play the game and output the result
The game plays until either the computer or user wins 3 rounds. 

The game could be improved by interaction and output through the camera screen instead of through the terminal. 
The ability to restart the game without rerunning the file would also be useful.
