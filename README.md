MILESTONE 1

Teachable-Machine is a web-based tool that creates machine learning models. This will be used to create a Rock/paper/scizzors game.

The machine has been taught with the labels Rock, Paper, Scizzors, Nothing.
The Tensorflow model is labeled: keras_model.hf
And the class labels: labels.txt

MILESTONE 2

Created new virtual environment using miniconda
Used: open-cv, tensorflow and ipykernal libraries 
Ran the machine learning model on the machine

MILESTONE 4

Created manual_rps.py to create a manual version of the game
Defined get_computer_choice function to generate a random selection of Rock, Paper or Scissors
Defined get_user_choice function to input from user 
Defined get_winner function to decide winner
Defined Play function to play the game and output the result
